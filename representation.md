# String Representation of Javascript Property Changes

The primary string representation of Javascript entities is the JSON
representation provided by the language. We do not propose to change or
modify classic JSON, in fact, we encourage you to use JSON in contexts
where it suits your purpose. We offer another built in representation,
for preserving a record of change, in text form, that is concise and human
readable, as well as being easy to preserve, parse, process, and transmit.
