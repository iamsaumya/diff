## Breaking Changes; v2.x IS NOT Backwards Compatible with v1.x

> After more than 11 years, we chose to rebuild from scratch, the way we would code it today. If you've been around Node.js as long as we have, you've witnessed many great improvements in the way Javascript is written, and an evolution in the prevailing idioms. Since we chose to take on some of the more intense issues reported over the years, particularly how we report on array changes, we decided a rewrite was in order. Along the way, we purposely broke backward compatibility so we could grow the features. Github indicates this library is used by 300K projects... hopefully this new version also proves useful.
